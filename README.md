#Track & Field data project, January ISP

I've imported, wrangled and analyzed the data on historic menâ€™s olympic discus performance in trying to answer 
    What countries produce the best discus competitors
    If there is any correlation between the countries producing these athletes 
    Is there a correlation between age and athlete performance

#Using Readr, and Lubridate, and Countrycode I imported the data, and formatted the dataframe to prepare it for analysis
#Using Tidyverse I created several visualizations to gain insight from various aspects of the data
